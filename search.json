The proaboutblem with this approach that users who download the csv file from her website do not have a clear idea what these variables stand for, or what is the provenance of the work. Such information is available on Zenodo repository, but users who download the .csv file may forget about it.\nAfter: Rebeca can save the cult_emp_growth_sex dataset in R into an .rds file that contains all the DataCite or Dublin Core metadata that is required on Zenodo for publication. She can export this cult_emp_growth_sex.rds file into a CSV format that meets the W3C consortium’s standard on publishing CSV with machine-readable JSON metadata. She can also serialize for long-term usability the cult_emp_growth_sex it into an RDF schema that contains all the semantic information to connect this dataset to other data that use the SDMX semantic standards, such as other datasets of Eurostat, the World Bank or OECD.\n#  DataCite Metadata\nmetadata &lt;- list(\n  identifier = list(\n    identifierType = \"DOI\",\n    identifier = \"YourDOIHere\"\n  ),\n  creators = list(\n    list(\n      creatorName = \"Rebeca\",\n      creatorAffiliation = \"Rebeca_organization\"\n    )\n  ),\n  titles = list(\n    title = \"Cultural employment by sex\"\n  ),\n  publisher = \"Zenodo\",\n  publicationYear = \"2024\",\n  resourceType = list(\n    resourceTypeGeneral = \"Dataset\"\n  ),\n  descriptions = list(\n    list(\n      descriptionType = \"Abstract\",\n      description = \"A brief description of your dataset.\"\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Save metadata as a separate .rds file\nmetadata_file &lt;- \"metadata.rds\"\nsaveRDS(metadata, file = metadata_file)\n\n\nmetadata\n\n$identifier\n$identifier$identifierType\n[1] \"DOI\"\n\n$identifier$identifier\n[1] \"YourDOIHere\"\n\n\n$creators\n$creators[[1]]\n$creators[[1]]$creatorName\n[1] \"Rebeca\"\n\n$creators[[1]]$creatorAffiliation\n[1] \"Rebeca_organization\"\n\n\n\n$titles\n$titles$title\n[1] \"Cultural employment by sex\"\n\n\n$publisher\n[1] \"Zenodo\"\n\n$publicationYear\n[1] \"2024\"\n\n$resourceType\n$resourceType$resourceTypeGeneral\n[1] \"Dataset\"\n\n\n$descriptions\n$descriptions[[1]]\n$descriptions[[1]]$descriptionType\n[1] \"Abstract\"\n\n$descriptions[[1]]$description\n[1] \"A brief description of your dataset.\"\n# Save the dataset and metadata together in one .rds file\ncombined_data &lt;- list(\n  metadata = readRDS(metadata_file),\n  dataset = cult_emp_growth_sex\n)\n\n# Specify the filename for the combined .rds file\ncombined_file &lt;- \"cult_emp_growth_sex_with_metadata.rds\"\n\n# Save the combined data\nsaveRDS(combined_data, file = combined_file)\ncult_emp_growth_sex_data &lt;- readRDS(\"cult_emp_growth_sex_with_metadata.rds\")$dataset\ncsv_filename &lt;- \"cult_emp_growth_sex.csv\"\n\nwrite.csv(cult_emp_growth_sex_data, file = csv_filename, row.names = FALSE)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nmetadata &lt;- list(\n  \"@context\" = \"http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw\",\n  \"@type\" = \"Dataset\",\n  \"name\" = \"Cultural Employment Growth Data\",\n  \"description\" = \"A dataset containing cultural employment growth data.\",\n  \"identifier\" = \"https://example.com/datasets/cult_emp_growth_sex.csv\",\n  \"url\" = \"https://example.com/datasets/cult_emp_growth_sex.csv\",\n  \"datePublished\" = \"2024-01-23\",\n  \"creator\" = list(\n    \"@type\" = \"Person\",\n    \"name\" = \"Your Name\",\n    \"email\" = \"your@email.com\"\n  ),\n  \"license\" = \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\",\n  \"encodingFormat\" = \"text/csv\"\n)\n\njson_metadata_filename &lt;- \"metadata.json\"\n\nwriteLines(toJSON(metadata, pretty = TRUE), json_metadata_filename)\n\n\njson_metadata_filename\n\n[1] \"metadata.json\"",
